# Commodetto

Commodetto is a graphics library designed to bring modern user interface rendering to devices powered by resource constrained micro-controllers. For many applications, Commodetto needs only a few kilobytes of RAM. Commodetto achieves its small memory footprint in part through Poco, a lightweight rendering engine capable of efficiently drawing a single scan line at a time.

Commodetto integrates with the [XS6](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/tree/master/xs6) JavaScript virtual machine to provide an ES6 JavaScript API for working with graphics on micro-controllers.
